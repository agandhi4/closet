# Closet

A private, self-hosted household wardrobe PWA. Catalog garments with photos (backgrounds removed automatically), compose outfits, plan them on a calendar, and share a wardrobe between users.

## Quick start

Closet needs PostgreSQL 18, the version every test tier runs; the example below brings its own. Give the container about 5 GB of memory: the background-removal model (940 MB, downloaded on first boot into `closet_models`) runs in a child process outside Node's heap.

<!-- smoke:quickstart -->

`scripts/smoke-image.sh` runs the block below as written (the image name, the two `<...>` placeholders and the host port aside) and waits for `/health/ready`.

```yaml
services:
  closet:
    image: ghcr.io/kashhq/closet:latest
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
    volumes:
      - closet_data:/app/data
      # The model is downloaded once; without this volume every `up -d` after a pull downloads it again.
      - closet_models:/app/models
    environment:
      # Required: signs the session cookies. openssl rand -hex 32
      ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET: '<secret>'
      # The household's time zone: decides "today" on the calendar.
      APP_TIMEZONE: America/New_York
      # Installable app, offline shell and push reminders. Needs HTTPS: see "Behind HTTPS" below.
      PWA_ENABLED: 'false'
      # Behind HTTPS, set PWA_ENABLED to 'true' and add (SITE_URL must be https://, the VAPID subject):
      # SITE_URL: https://closet.example.com
      # TRUSTED_PROXIES: <your reverse proxy's address>
      # Generate the pair with: npx web-push generate-vapid-keys
      # PUBLIC_VAPID_KEY: '<public key>'
      # PRIVATE_VAPID_KEY: '<private key>'
      DATA_PATH: /app/data
      DATABASE_HOST: postgres
      DATABASE_SCHEMA: closet
      DATABASE_USER: closet
      DATABASE_PASS: '<password>'
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy
    restart: unless-stopped
  postgres:
    image: postgres:18-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: closet
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: '<password>'
      POSTGRES_DB: closet
    volumes:
      # Postgres 18 images keep the version's data directory under this path.
      - closet_pg:/var/lib/postgresql
    healthcheck:
      test: ['CMD-SHELL', 'pg_isready -U closet -d closet']
      interval: 5s
      retries: 10
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  closet_data:
  closet_models:
  closet_pg:
```

**Upgrading from the earlier Postgres 17 example.** Postgres 18 keeps its data under `/var/lib/postgresql`, so pointing this block at a 17 volume starts an empty cluster and Closet migrates into an empty database: your wardrobe looks gone. To keep your data:

1. On the old stack, run `docker compose exec postgres pg_dumpall -U closet > closet.sql`, then stop it.
2. Start only the database of the new one: `docker compose up -d postgres`. A full `up` would start Closet, which migrates the empty cluster first and makes the restore collide with what it created.
3. Restore with `docker compose exec -T postgres psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -U closet -d postgres < closet.sql`.
4. Start Closet: `docker compose up -d`.

**Behind HTTPS.** The installed app, its offline shell and push need a secure origin. With `PWA_ENABLED: 'true'` the server refuses to start unless `SITE_URL` is an `https://` URL and both VAPID keys are set, and it names the missing key. Set `TRUSTED_PROXIES` to your reverse proxy so the client address is read correctly.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and register an account: login is always required. Once everyone in the household has signed up, set `DISABLE_REGISTRATION=true`.

## Connect your Claude

Closet is an MCP server: your own Claude (Claude Code, Claude Desktop) can search your wardrobe, add pieces from product links, build outfits and capsules, plan days, keep track of wears and laundry, and compare your closet with a wardrobe shared with you to talk through what to buy next.

1. In the app, open **Profile › Agent Access** (`/auth/tokens`) and create a token; it asks for your password, since a token keeps working after you sign out. The token is shown once, and the page also shows the command below with it filled in.
2. Add the server to Claude Code:

   ```bash
   claude mcp add --transport http closet https://<your SITE_URL host>/mcp \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
   ```

   In Claude Desktop, add the same URL and header as a remote MCP server.

The token acts as you, shares included: a wardrobe shared with you read-only stays read-only. Tools that write say so, and none deletes anything. Revoke a token on the same page; changing your password revokes every token. The endpoint is rate-limited per token. If the app is reachable only on a private network, an agent outside it needs a public endpoint for `/mcp` alone: a reverse proxy that forwards `POST /mcp` with the same `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header (Streamable HTTP, JSON answers) and answers 404 to everything else, so the app's pages stay private. Anything that can send a bearer header can use it; Claude's hosted connectors (claude.ai) that need OAuth still cannot, because OAuth is not built.

### Styling with an agent

An agent connected this way (Claude, or a styling agent such as Muse) suggests what to buy and how to wear it, as wishlist garments and outfits you decide on in the app.

1. **Connect** it as above, with a token of its own named for it (`Muse`): the name is how the app tells you who suggested what.
2. **The workflow** the server describes to the agent: it starts every conversation by reading what you decided since it last asked (`get_suggestion_feedback`: your choices, purchases and the outfits you loved or declined, with every reason and note) and what stands where (`list_suggestions`). It reads your style profile, your whole closet (with how often each piece is worn), your sizes per brand and photos where it needs them, and checks what your closet already covers (`get_closet_coverage`), so it proposes only real gaps and treats pieces marked replace soon as gaps. For each need it opens one on your wishlist ("A navy blazer", with a budget and why) and adds two to five real products as its options (`suggest_garment`), each with a note, its rank, the price and the size to buy. Then it proposes outfits that mix your clothes with its options (`suggest_outfit`), and ends the round (`finish_round`).
3. **What you see in the app**: a card on **Today** ("Muse: 3 outfits, 7 pieces to consider") while anything of its latest round waits, and a notification on each device where you turned on **When Muse finishes a round** (Profile, notifications); the needs and their options in **Wardrobe › Wishlist** (choose **This one**, or **Not for me** with a reason), the outfits first on **Outfits** (**Love**, **Save**, or **Not for me**), and the options in Styling with **Include picks** on.
4. **Your decisions are its feedback**: a reason you give is what it reads next time, and it never proposes again a need, product or outfit you set aside (the app refuses it). Buying stays yours: an agent never buys, marks anything owned or deletes; you tap **Bought it**, and it later learns how often you wear what you bought.

## Configuration

`.env` contains committed defaults. Override any value via a `.env.local` file (gitignored) or by passing real environment variables to Docker.

Generate the session signing secret (anyone who knows it can sign in as any user, so never reuse an example value; changing it signs everyone out):

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Generate VAPID keys:

```bash
npx web-push generate-vapid-keys
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node (see `.nvmrc`, Node 22, an exact version: devkit's toolchain-check holds the
  Dockerfile and workflows to it) - install via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- Docker, for Postgres. Development and tests use the shared local
  **pgvault-dev** (a sibling `../pgvault-dev` compose project: Postgres on
  `localhost:5432`, superuser `postgres`, trust auth).

```bash
nvm install && nvm use
npm install
make install                                      # git hooks, once per checkout or worktree
(cd ../pgvault-dev && docker compose up -d --wait)
docker compose -f ../pgvault-dev/docker-compose.yml exec postgres \
  psql -U postgres -c 'create database closet_db'   # once
cat > .env.local <<ENV                              # gitignored
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_SCHEMA=closet_db
DATABASE_USER=postgres
DATABASE_PASS=
ENV
npm run start:dev
```

The integration tier and the page audit never touch `closet_db`: each run
creates scratch databases on the server named by `TEST_DATABASE_URL`
(default `postgres://postgres@localhost:5432/postgres`, pgvault-dev) and drops
them afterwards.

### Scripts

```bash
npm run start:dev       # tsc --watch + node --watch + tailwind --watch
npm run build           # clean, tsc -p tsconfig.build.json (type-checked) to dist/, then generate:
                        # build-info, vendor, Tailwind, the service worker, precompress
npm run start:prod      # node dist/main.js
npm run start:test      # the build with background removal stubbed (test/support/test-server.ts: what Playwright
                        # and Lighthouse start; no model download)
npm run test            # Vitest unit projects (unit, unit-new-york): mocked DB/fs, verifies wiring
                        # (test:watch reruns on change; test:debug waits for an inspector on :9229)
npm run test:int        # Vitest integration tests (real app in-process, scratch Postgres database per
                        # file, cloned from the migrated template; no build): the default place for
                        # behavior assertions
npm run test:all        # both Vitest tiers in one run
npm run test:e2e        # build, then Playwright end-to-end (all browsers, ten critical-path scenarios;
                        # make screenshots for the shots); starts start:test on :3000 unless one is
                        # running, and the PWA scenarios skip unless PWA_ENABLED (test/AGENTS.md)
npm run test:cov        # both Vitest tiers with v8 coverage (coverage/); the plan's metrics ratchet holds lines and branches
npm run audit:pages     # every page and action measured as the demo persona, see below
npm run generate:icons  # regenerate public/assets/icon.png, icon-192.png, icon-512.png and favicon.ico from icon.svg
npm run lint            # eslint --fix over src, test, scripts; lint:check is the no-fix, cached gate
npm run format          # prettier --write (never on a bare directory); format:check is the cached gate
npm run typecheck       # tsc over app, tests and scripts, then the service worker (~3 s cold)
npm run check           # format, lint, types, unit + integration in parallel (~80 s on 16 cores;
                        # check:static is the first three; `precommit` is an alias). The plan runs
                        # the two halves as the jobs make ci-quick and make ci-db
npm run verify:push     # build + Chromium Playwright (main is verified by the plan's e2e job at deploy)
npm run precommit:full  # check + verify:push + page audit + lighthouse (minutes)
npm run maintenance:reconcile [-- --dry-run] [--force]
                        # one storage reconciliation pass (needs `npm run build`; see below)
npm run maintenance:retrim-thumbs [-- --dry-run]
                        # trim every cutout's thumb to its garment, once after upgrading past #373
                        # (needs `npm run build`; on the NAS: docker exec closet npm run ...)
npm run user:set-password -- <email>
                        # set a locked-out user's password (needs `npm run build`; see below)
npm run cutout:fetch-model
                        # download or verify the background-removal model into MODELS_PATH
                        # (needs `npm run build`; see Background removal)
```

The server downloads the model (940 MB) into `MODELS_PATH` at its first boot,
so `start:dev` and `start:prod` fetch it once into `./models`; point
`MODELS_PATH` at an existing copy in `.env.local` to skip that. `npm run
test:int` includes one test with the real model; it runs only when
`MODELS_PATH` (or `./models`) holds it and is skipped otherwise (CI never
downloads it).

### The gate's jobs and the git hooks

`scripts/ci/gate_plan.sh` is the plan: the publisher host runs every job of it on
main (`devkit/bin/check_tree.sh`, at most once per 3 h window) before it ships,
and a red main files a `main-red` issue. The Makefile targets are thin callers of
the npm scripts (`ci.yml`'s manual jobs call the same ones), and each brings its
own throwaway Postgres 18 container, so none needs pgvault-dev.

```bash
make ci-deps ci-quick         # npm ci; ci-guards, secrets-check, ci-lint, ci-typecheck
make ci-unit                  # the unit projects
make ci-db                    # test:cov on Postgres 18 (coverage feeds the metrics ratchet)
make ci-e2e                   # build + Chromium Playwright, PWA on, a random PORT
                              # (each of the three reports against its budget, 60/110/180 s, and a floor)
make ci-metrics               # the metrics report (never fails, not in the plan): scripts/ci/metrics.conf
                              # vs docs/metrics/ratchet.json
make metrics-tighten          # a cleanup round keeps its gains in docs/metrics/ratchet.json
make ci-image ci-smoke CI_BUILD_VERSION=<v>   # build the image and boot it (docs/operations.md)
make review PR=<n>            # one local review round (when Codex is out of budget)
make merge PR=<n>             # squash-merge once the review rounds allow it
```

devkit is not in the tree: `.devkit-rev` pins its commit and `.devkit-bootstrap.sh`
materializes it into the gitignored `devkit/` before every `make` target and hook
(`make devkit-sync` bumps the pin). The git hooks are devkit's templates in
`.githooks/`: `make install` once per checkout or worktree materializes `devkit/`,
sets `core.hooksPath`, and `make hooks-check` reports a repoint. Their steps are `scripts/ci/hooks.conf` (ci-quick plus ci-unit, split
between pre-commit and pre-push); neither needs Postgres or a browser.

### Locked out

There is no password reset by email. Whoever runs the server sets a new
password for an account with `npm run user:set-password -- <email>` (in a
container: `docker exec -it closet npm run user:set-password -- <email>`). It
asks for the password twice without echoing it (or reads one line from piped
stdin), applies the registration rules, and signs out every existing session
of that account. An unknown email changes nothing and exits with status 1.

Neither this nor the storage maintenance command migrates the database: they
refuse, with exit status 1, a database the running build has not migrated
yet. Start the server of that build first (it migrates at boot).

### Storage maintenance

Every photo is a set of files in storage (`<uuid>.webp` plus `-nobg` and
`-thumb` variants) and one `file` row. Deleting a garment or an account
removes both, and a nightly job (03:00 in `APP_TIMEZONE`, `MAINTENANCE_ENABLED`)
keeps them describing each other: stored photo sets older than a day with no
row are deleted, rows older than a day that no garment references are deleted
with their files, and rows whose original is missing are logged. Run it by
hand, on the NAS with `docker exec closet npm run maintenance:reconcile`, or
locally after `npm run build`; `-- --dry-run` only reports.

A run that would delete anything while the `file` table is empty, more than
25 photo sets, or more than a fifth of the stored ones (once it is more than 5) deletes nothing: it logs why, reports `refused` and exits with status 3.
That is the database and the disk disagreeing wholesale (a restore, the wrong
database), not stray uploads. Check with `-- --dry-run`, then
`-- --force` deletes anyway.

### Background removal

Every garment photo gets a cutout (its background removed) on the server.
The phone first shrinks a large photo to 1600 px (JPEG) and sends only the
photo. The server queues it (the garment page shows "Removing background…"
and swaps the cutout in when it is ready, or offers "Try again" if it
failed) and runs
[BiRefNet 512x512](https://huggingface.co/onnx-community/BiRefNet_512x512-ONNX)
(MIT) with onnxruntime on the CPU, in a child process, one photo at a time:
about 3 s a photo on a recent 8-core CPU (7 s for the first after a start or
15 idle minutes, which loads the model) and up to ~3.5 GB of RAM while the
model is loaded. It needs a CPU with AVX2 or better. A photo that takes over
60 s is failed; failed ones are retried nightly (03:00 in `APP_TIMEZONE`) up
to three runs. The mask editor (the pencil on the photo) edits the cutout,
and an edited cutout is never replaced by the server's.

The model is not in the image. It is downloaded into `MODELS_PATH` at boot
when it is not there yet, from a pinned URL, and refused unless its SHA-256
matches. Give it a local volume so it is fetched once; to seed or repair it:

```bash
docker exec closet npm run cutout:fetch-model   # download or verify; prints the path
```

Photos stored before background removal moved to the server (it ran in the
browser until 2026-09-26) keep the cutouts the browser made.

### Page audit

`npm run audit:pages` builds the app, boots it in process on a scratch
Postgres database with the demo persona seeded, and measures every page,
fragment, action, MCP tool and background job as Theo: server time p50/p95,
SQL statements and rows per request, response bytes. It writes
`scripts/results/audit.md` and `.json`; `-- --compare docs/perf/baseline.json`
prints what changed against the committed baseline. How a page PR uses it:
[docs/perf/README.md](docs/perf/README.md).

### Migrations

The schema is `src/db/schema.ts` (Drizzle). The app applies the migrations in
`drizzle/` on every boot, so a deploy is the migration.

```bash
# After editing src/db/schema.ts: writes drizzle/NNNN_<name>.sql and its
# snapshot. Needs no database. Read the SQL before committing it.
npx drizzle-kit generate --name <what-changed>
```

Databases created before Drizzle took over (built by MikroORM's migrations)
are adopted on their first boot: the runner checks that the last MikroORM
migration was applied and records the Drizzle baseline without running it.

A migration that converts data refuses to guess: it fails the boot, changes
nothing, and names what to fix. `0004_garment_web` (garment colours become a
fixed set, the acquisition date a plain date) stops on a colour outside the
built-in set (older builds let people type their own), an acquisition date
that is not UTC midnight, a blank category, or a share id two rows hold. To
check a database before upgrading:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT unnest(string_to_array(color, ',')) FROM garment;  -- built-in names only
SELECT count(*) FROM garment
 WHERE (date_aquired AT TIME ZONE 'UTC')::time <> '00:00'
    OR btrim(category) = '';                                       -- 0
```

### Docker build

```bash
# Build image
docker build --no-cache . -t closet:latest

# Cross-compile for linux/amd64 (e.g. building on Apple Silicon for a VPS)
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 --no-cache . -t closet:latest
```

## Architecture

One Node 22 process: plain Fastify 5 serving server-rendered JSX pages with htmx, Drizzle over PostgreSQL, photos on disk under `DATA_PATH`, and background removal in a child process running an ONNX model. A Workbox service worker makes it an installable PWA, and `/mcp` exposes the wardrobe to Claude. The source tree and the area index are in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#architecture), each piece in full in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md), and the web layer in [docs/web-layer.md](docs/web-layer.md).

---

## Deploy

This instance runs on the homelab, and merging to `main` deploys it: the homelab's publisher host (`make publish`, at most once per 3 h, once main's checks pass) pushes `ghcr.io/kashhq/closet:latest` and a `ship-<date>-<sha7>` tag, and the hourly autoupdater pulls the image. The pieces, the production env, deploying by hand and recovery are in [docs/operations.md](docs/operations.md).

For other self-hosters: deploy to a VPS via [Coolify](https://coolify.io/) or Portainer using the docker-compose above, with local storage. Back up both the Postgres database and `DATA_PATH`, taken close together: the nightly storage reconciliation deletes photos that no database row references.
