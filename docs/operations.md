# Deployment

What applies to any install: the env, permissions, health, recovery and publishing. The owner's production (the production host in the homelab, its hosts, paths, DNS, proxies and the public MCP host) is documented in the private homelab repo, `stacks/closet/README.md`, never here: this repo is public (2026-11-12, "Homelab topology lives in the homelab repo"; devkit's docs-check and devkit-check refuse it).

| Piece      | Value                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| URL        | `SITE_URL`, HTTPS: the PWA (service worker, push) needs a secure context. A plain-HTTP twin serves pages but no service worker                              |
| Image      | `ghcr.io/kashhq/closet:latest`, amd64, published by the owner's publisher (CI and publishing) once main is green and the image boots                        |
| Container  | port 3000, uid 1000 (Permissions), about 5 GB of memory (the model child's native memory is outside Node's heap)                                            |
| Database   | PostgreSQL 18, one database and role for closet (`DATABASE_*`, README Configuration)                                                                        |
| Photos     | `DATA_PATH`, a host mount writable by uid 1000; a network share works (production's is NFS)                                                                 |
| Model      | `MODELS_PATH`, local disk (BiRefNet 512, downloaded and checksum-verified at first boot)                                                                    |
| Public MCP | optional: a reverse proxy that forwards only `POST /mcp` and 404s everything else (README, Connect your Claude). The personal access token is the only gate |

**Database connection.** `DATABASE_SSL` is `verify` (with `DATABASE_SSL_CA` for a private CA), `no-verify` (encrypted, any certificate accepted: a trusted network only) or `off` (README Configuration). Connect directly or through a session-mode pooler: a transaction-mode pooler (PgBouncer `pool_mode=transaction`) is unsupported, since the migrations' advisory lock, the cutout listener's LISTEN and the session timeouts all need a session.

**Error tracking.** `SENTRY_DSN` is the DSN of closet's project in a Bugsink (Sentry-compatible; Bugsink shows it on the project's page). The container must reach its host: the boot log says `Error tracking: on (<host>, release <sha7>, environment production)`, and a `Could not send an event to Bugsink` warning (logger `ErrorTracking`) means it cannot. Each event's `release` is the image's `APP_VERSION`, the bare 7-char sha: the publisher passes it as a build arg, the Dockerfile's final stage bakes it in as env and as the `org.opencontainers.image.version` label, and `src/build-info.ts` resolves it once at boot (`BuildInfo.release`), so `/health/ready`, the pages' beacon and the server report the same release, the one the image tag `sha-<7>` names with its prefix. Its `environment` is `APP_ENV`: `production` by default, `gate` in the smoke test, `dev` for `npm run start:dev` and the tests. Compose never sets it. A local `npm run build` names its release from `git rev-parse HEAD` (`public/build.json`); without either (`start:dev`, the tests) it is `dev`. What is captured and how it is scrubbed: `src/metrics/AGENTS.md`, Error tracking.

**Order email import** (#25; `src/web/wardrobe/order-mail.md`). Off until the token is set. The owner's steps, once:

1. Create a Fastmail account used for nothing else (the order address). Closet only ever reads it.
2. In that account, Settings › Privacy & Security › Manage API tokens › New API token ([Fastmail's help](https://www.fastmail.help/hc/en-us/articles/5254602856719-API-tokens)). Give it **Email** access only, tick **Read-only access**, and leave every other scope (contacts, calendars, sending, masked email) unticked. Copy the token (`fmu1-…`): Fastmail shows it once.
3. Put the token and the owner's addresses in `closet.env` (above): `ORDER_MAIL_SENDERS` lists every address the owner forwards from, and `ORDER_MAIL_OWNER` is the email the owner signs in to closet with. The homelab compose file must pass the three variables through to the container. Redeploy.
4. Forward an order confirmation **by hand** to the order address (an auto-forward rule keeps the retailer as From and is ignored). Within `ORDER_MAIL_POLL_MINUTES` its products show under Wardrobe › ⋯ › From your orders.

The boot log says `Order mail: on (Fastmail, every 5 min, N trusted senders)`; each poll logs one line (logger `OrderMail`), and each ignored email says why (`untrusted (sender-not-allowed, from <domain>)`). A failing poll (a revoked token is `JMAP session refused (http-status 401)`) counts as `job_duration_seconds{name="order_mail",outcome="failure"}` and reaches Bugsink; the token never appears in logs or events. To turn it off, unset the token and redeploy; the review list's rows stay. To rotate, create a new token, swap it in, redeploy, then revoke the old one in Fastmail.

**Trusted proxies.** `TRUSTED_PROXIES` must include the address Caddy connects from (Request security). Check with the boot log line `Trusted proxies: ...` and a rate-limit hit's `for <ip>` warning: it must name the client, not Caddy.

**Demo login.** `docker exec closet npm run seed -- --persona demo --share-with <owner email>` seeds Theo (a random password, printed once; registration stays disabled, the CLI inserts the user) and shares his wardrobe with the owner's account. `--reset` (with `--share-with` again) after the bible changes; `--persona demo --remove` takes it out, and `npm run maintenance:reconcile -- --dry-run` then reports nothing. The hourly autoupdate never reseeds. A forgotten password: `user:set-password -- demo@closet.invalid`.

**Trimmed thumbs (#373), once.** After the deploy that trims new cutouts' thumbs to the garment, on the host: `docker exec closet npm run maintenance:retrim-thumbs -- --dry-run` (counts the thumbs `due`), then without `--dry-run`. Each photo with a ready or edited cutout gets its trimmed thumb under a new variant key, so phones fetch it; the replaced files go with the swap. A second run reports them `current`. Exit 1 names failed photos in warn lines (logger `ThumbRetrim`); run it again. src/maintenance/AGENTS.md, Commands.

**Locked out.** There is no email reset. On the host: `docker exec -it closet npm run user:set-password -- <email>` asks for the new password twice without echoing it (or reads it from piped stdin), applies the registration rules, and signs out every session of that account (its access tokens and push subscriptions revoked with them). An unknown email exits 1 and changes nothing, and so does a database the running build has not migrated yet (it never migrates).

**One container at a time.** `container_name: closet` makes `docker compose up -d` stop and remove the old container before the new one starts, so two builds never serve or write photos together (the new one migrates at boot). **Rolling back past #141** (the variant-key cutouts, `drizzle/0027`) is not free: the older build serves only unkeyed cutout names, and every cutout made or edited since was stored keyed with its unkeyed predecessor deleted, so those photos show their original until cut again; a mask edit the older build saves bumps the version without touching `variant_key`, so the newer build, back again, serves the key's older mask. After such a round trip, `update file set variant_key = null where variant_key is not null and file_name in (...)` for the photos edited meanwhile, then re-cut or re-edit them.

**Rotating the secret.** Set a new `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` (`openssl rand -hex 32`) in `closet.env`, redeploy, then `docker exec closet npm run push:revoke-all`: the rotation signed everyone out, and a device left closed would otherwise keep receiving its account's reminders until it next opened the app (the login page drops its browser subscription then). After the restart, not before: a session still open re-sends its subscription on its next page. Everyone signs in again and re-enables notifications and reminders on the profile. Personal access tokens are unaffected (Request security, Session revocation).

**Rolling back past 0057 (#678).** 0057 keys the weather caches by zone, and an image from before it upserts on `(latitude, longitude)`, which no longer has a unique constraint: its forecasts would fail to save. Before starting the older image, on the database (the caches refill on the next asks), after rolling back every later migration the same way (Migrations and rollback, below):

```sql
BEGIN;
SET LOCAL lock_timeout = '5s';
TRUNCATE weather_forecast, weather_normals;
ALTER TABLE weather_forecast DROP CONSTRAINT weather_forecast_pkey, DROP COLUMN time_zone,
  ADD CONSTRAINT weather_forecast_pkey PRIMARY KEY (latitude, longitude);
ALTER TABLE weather_normals DROP CONSTRAINT weather_normals_pkey, DROP COLUMN time_zone,
  ADD CONSTRAINT weather_normals_pkey PRIMARY KEY (latitude, longitude);
ALTER TABLE trip DROP CONSTRAINT trip_time_zone_check, DROP COLUMN time_zone;
-- 0057's row (its journal when): without this the older image refuses to boot (#651).
DELETE FROM drizzle.__drizzle_migrations WHERE created_at = 1794628538738;
COMMIT;
```

Rolling forward again is a plain deploy: 0057 runs again on the next boot.

**No deploy overlap for 0057.** Until an old container stops, its forecast and normals upserts would fail against the new keys, but there is no such window: `container_name: closet` makes `docker compose up -d` stop and remove the old container before the new one starts and migrates (One container at a time, above). That is this repo's documented behaviour; the compose file itself is homelab's (`stacks/closet/README.md`) and is not readable from here, so a change there to start-before-stop would bring the window back: the old build's saves fail (logged, the caches refill) until it stops, nothing else is lost.

Deploy now, data fixes and production's paths: homelab `stacks/closet/README.md`.

## Migrations and rollback

The boot migrates (Changing the schema in `AGENTS.md`), and drizzle records each migration in `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations` by its journal `when` (`created_at`). Since #651 the boot, the CLIs and readiness compare that history with the image's own `drizzle/` journal (`schemaState`, `src/db/migrate.ts`):

- **Behind** (the image has newer migrations): the server applies them at boot; the CLIs exit 1 (`The database is N migration(s) behind this build`) until it has.
- **Ahead** (the database's newest row is a migration the image does not have): the image is older than the database, typically a rollback to a previous `sha-` tag after a deploy that migrated. The boot refuses with the fatal line `The database's newest migration (journal when <ms>, generated <date>) is not in this build: the image is older than the database...`, before writing anything; the container restarts in a loop until fixed. The CLIs exit 1 with the same line, and a running server whose database a newer build migrated reads `migrations` down (`schema: "ahead"`). The `when` names the migration: find it in the newer build's `drizzle/meta/_journal.json`.

**Rolling back to an older image** is therefore one of two things. Either restore the pre-migration dump (below), the simple and complete one, losing what was written since; or, for each migration newer than the older image's newest, newest first, run its documented down steps (Rolling back past 0057 is one) and delete its row from `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations`. Once the newest row is one the older image knows, it is current to it and boots; the next deploy of the newer image applies the deleted ones again. Deleting a row without undoing its schema change is never a rollback: the older image then boots on a schema it does not know, which is what the refusal exists to prevent. A migration without written down steps is rolled back only by the dump.

**A deploy with pending migrations takes a dump first.** Whenever the incoming image has migrations the database has not applied (its `drizzle/meta/_journal.json` has a `when` newer than `select max(created_at) from drizzle.__drizzle_migrations`), the deploy runs `pg_dump -Fc closet_db` into a dated file before starting the new container, and keeps it until the next deploy with migrations replaces it. Several migrations are destructive (0041 drops `muse_look`, 0045 six plan tables) and the hourly autoupdater applies them with nobody present, so the dump is the rollback the night's cluster-wide dumpall is too coarse and too old for. Restore it with `pg_restore --clean --if-exists -d closet_db <file>` with the container stopped, then start the older image. The deploy script lives in homelab: this rule is tracked in homelab.

## Permissions

The image runs as `node`, **uid/gid 1000** (the Dockerfile's `USER`), never root. It writes exactly two directories, both host mounts in production, and a mount keeps the host's ownership, so both must be writable by uid 1000 on the host:

| In the container              | What writes it                          |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `/app/data` (`DATA_PATH`)     | photos, `.incoming/`, `.closet-storage`, `.trash/` (reconciliation's quarantine) |
| `/app/models` (`MODELS_PATH`) | the model's download at first boot      |

The opt-in `LOG_FILE` is not a third path the image owns: it must point into a mount you provide that uid 1000 can write (never under `DATA_PATH`). It never creates a directory; one that is missing or unwritable ends in a single `error` line on stdout and a file-less run, the console log unaffected.

```bash
# On the host, as root: give uid 1000 both directories (a root-owned one is what the root image's
# download left). A network share that squashes every client user may refuse the chown and not need it.
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 <data dir> <models dir>
# Prove both as uid 1000 with the image itself:
docker run --rm --user 1000:1000 -v <data dir>:/d -v <models dir>:/m --entrypoint sh \
  ghcr.io/kashhq/closet:latest -c 'for d in /d /m; do touch $d/.probe && rm $d/.probe || exit 1; done; echo writable'
```

**The symptom** of a directory uid 1000 cannot write: a root-owned `/app/data` ends the boot (the container restarts in a loop) with the fatal line `DATA_PATH /app/data is not writable by this process (EACCES): chown -R 1000:1000 the host directory mounted at /app/data; docs/operations.md#permissions`, before anything else is logged. A root-owned `/app/models` boots and serves pages, but `/health/ready` answers 503 with `storage` down and that chown as its `fix`, the container goes unhealthy and autoheal restarts it, and the model download fails (`Downloading BiRefNet 512x512 failed`, `EACCES`). A directory that stops being writable later (the NFS share remounted read-only) shows the same `storage` check within 5 s. `docker exec closet ...` runs as uid 1000 too (`npm` caches under `/home/node`).

## Backup

Closet keeps no backup of its own. A backup is the operator's database dump plus the photo share (`DATA_PATH`, `.closet-storage` and `.trash` included), taken as a pair (see the README's upgrade notes). Profile's garment-list export (CSV/JSON) is a spreadsheet of garments only: no photo files, outfits, calendar, wears, washes, capsules, trips, sizes, style profile, selfies or saved looks, and it is no substitute.

## Photo storage marker

`DATA_PATH` carries a `.closet-storage` file (JSON: a random `installId` and `createdAt`), so the app never reads a bare mountpoint (the NFS share not mounted, or the wrong host directory) as "every photo is gone" (#650). The boot writes it only when it can prove the directory is the household's: the `file` table is empty (a first boot), or the directory holds the photos of at least 90% of the table's rows (an existing share from before the marker, adopted at the first boot after the deploy, logged at warn as `adopted an unmarked directory holding the photos of N of M rows`). A few stray uploads left on a bare mountpoint never pass that. It is never served by `/file/**` and never counted by reconciliation. Copy it with the photos in any backup.

**The symptom** of an unmounted share, or a `DATA_PATH` pointing at the wrong directory, with photo rows in the database: the boot ends (the container restarts in a loop) with the fatal line `DATA_PATH has no .closet-storage marker: the photo share is not mounted, or DATA_PATH is the wrong directory (docs/operations.md#photo-storage-marker)`, and the marker is not written there (the warn line before it says how many rows' photos it found). A marker that cannot be read (a stale NFS handle, `EIO`, `EACCES`, or content that is not a marker) refuses the boot and turns `storage` down the same way, as `DATA_PATH storage unreadable: <code>`; a marker that is not one is never overwritten: check it, then delete it to let the boot adopt. The CLIs (`maintenance:reconcile`, `retrim-thumbs`, `seed`) exit 1 with the same line. A share unmounted, or another install's share mounted, under a running server turns `/health/ready`'s `storage` check down (pointing here) within 5 s, and the nightly reconciliation refuses and deletes nothing, pending photos included; so does a run that finds `file` rows and not one stored photo set, marker or not. `--force` overrides none of these.

**Recovery.** Mount the share (check `mount` and the host directory behind `CLOSET_DATA_DIR`) and restart the container; nothing is to be fixed in the app. After restoring a share from a backup that lacks the marker, put the backup's `.closet-storage` back if you have it; otherwise the first boot adopts the restored directory as long as it holds the photos of 90% of the rows. A restored directory holding the photos of fewer than 90% of the rows is refused on purpose: restore the photos, or, if the household really lost them, re-adopt by hand (below) or remove the rows (`file` and what references them) before the boot. To re-adopt by hand (only once you have checked the directory is the right one), as uid 1000: `docker run --rm --user 1000:1000 -v <data dir>:/d --entrypoint sh ghcr.io/kashhq/closet:latest -c 'printf "{\"installId\":\"%s\",\"createdAt\":\"%s\"}\n" $(cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid) $(date -u +%FT%TZ) > /d/.closet-storage'`, then pair it (below) and restart. A running server compares the marker with the one it booted with, so restart after any change to it.

**Which database it belongs to** (#833). The database records the marker's install id in its one-row `install` table, written by the claim that writes or adopts the marker; a deploy of #833 over a marked share writes it at its first boot from the marker already there (`Photo storage <id> paired with this database`). From then on a marker whose install id is not the database's (another household's or a staging copy's share mounted, or the database restored from another install's dump) refuses the boot and the CLIs with `DATA_PATH holds the .closet-storage of another install than the one this database belongs to: ...` (the warn line before it names both install ids), and the nightly reconciliation refuses, `--force` or not, when the database was restored or repointed under a running server. Readiness's `storage` check does not read the row (it compares the marker with the id the boot claimed and paired, in memory), so a database out of reach is only the `database` check. **Enforced only with `APP_ENV=production`**: in `dev` and `gate` (worktrees sharing pgvault-dev, each with its own `DATA_PATH`) a mismatch is one warn line, `Using photo storage <id>: this database belongs to install <id> (not refused outside APP_ENV production)`, and the boot goes on; the marker rules above apply in every environment. A marker the boot writes on an adopted, unmarked share carries the database's install id, so a share restored without its marker and re-adopted at 90% pairs by itself.

**Re-pairing** after a deliberate restore onto new storage, a re-adoption by hand, or a database moved to another share on purpose: first check that `DATA_PATH` is the right share and that the database is the household's, then pair the database with the marker the share holds now. The container is in a restart loop, so run it as a one-off container with the service's environment and mounts: `docker compose run --rm --no-deps closet npm run maintenance:reconcile -- --repair-storage-identity --confirm` (from the stack's directory), then restart. Without `--confirm` it only says what it would do and exits 2; it prints `{"paired": "<install id>"}` and exits 0, or refuses with exit 3 when `DATA_PATH` has no marker or an unreadable one (it never writes a marker, so an unmounted share is never paired). The warn line `Storage identity repaired: the database now belongs to photo storage <new> (was <old>)` is the record.

## Photo quarantine

The nightly reconciliation never deletes a photo set that has no `file` row: it moves it into `DATA_PATH/.trash/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<uuid>.webp/` (a rename on the same filesystem; the day is `APP_TIMEZONE`'s) and deletes a day directory once it is more than 30 days old (#649). After restoring the database from a dump older than the photos, the photos added since land there the next night (log lines `Quarantined orphaned ...`, the report's `orphanedSetsQuarantined`). To put one back: `docker exec closet npm run maintenance:reconcile -- --restore-from-trash <uuid>.webp` (or `<day>/<entry>` when it was quarantined twice); it refuses when a live set of that name exists. Restore its `file` row too, or the next night quarantines it again. Keep `.trash` with the photos in a backup to keep those 30 days too.

## Health

`GET /health/live` checks nothing (the phones' connectivity heartbeat). `GET /health/ready` (alias `/healthz`) is what the image's `HEALTHCHECK` (every 30 s, 60 s start period), the smoke boot and devkit's contract probe read: 200 `{"status": "up", "version": "<sha7>", "checks": {...}}`, or 503 `"down"` when a required check is down. It is limited to 60 a minute per address. Each down check names this section as its `fix`, and the log line (logger `Health`, `Readiness: ...`) says why:

- **`database`** (required): the pool's one statement did not answer in 3 s or failed. Check the Postgres server and `CLOSET_DB_HOST`; the app recovers by itself once it answers.
- **`migrations`** (required): `schema: "behind"`, the database's newest Drizzle migration is older than this build's, so it was restored or repointed after the boot: restart the container, the boot migrates. `schema: "ahead"`, a newer build migrated the database under this one: deploy that build, or roll the schema back (Migrations and rollback).
- **`storage`** (required): a directory the process writes (`DATA_PATH`, `MODELS_PATH`) refused a create and unlink as uid 1000; its `fix` is the chown and the log line names the directory and the error code. Or `DATA_PATH` lost the marker the boot claimed, or holds another install's: its `fix` points to Photo storage marker (no database statement: the pairing is checked at boot). Probed at most once every 5 s: see Permissions.
- **`cron_jobs`** (optional): a timer's run has been in flight over 30 minutes (`stuck` names it). Its last `cron-` lines in Loki say where it hangs; a restart starts it afresh.
- **`cutout_queue`** (optional): `CUTOUT_ENABLED=false` reports it `up` with `"disabled": true` (the operator's choice: no model is fetched or run, uploads keep their original). Otherwise it is down when the background-removal queue is not running (in production, the process is shutting down), or it waits for a model it cannot have: `reason` says why and `fix` what to do (`download`: huggingface.co refused or unreachable; `checksum`: the file in `MODELS_PATH` is not the pinned model, `npm run cutout:fetch-model`; `permission`: see Permissions; `binding`: onnxruntime-node has no native binding for this platform, the image must be linux/amd64; `other`: the `Cutout queue waiting for the model` log line). Photos stay pending meanwhile (the garment page stops polling after 2 minutes and says it will finish later) and are cut out as soon as the model loads, without a restart; `cutout_queue_oldest_age_seconds` shows how long they have waited.

Optional checks never make the app down: every page still serves while one is down, and a restart loop would cost the household the app. Compose inherits the image's `HEALTHCHECK`; without a restarter (an `autoheal` container, or an orchestrator) an unhealthy container is only marked, never restarted.

## CI and publishing

- **No pre-merge gate; main is proven at deploy** (devkit 2026-11-02): a PR merges on review rounds (`@codex review`, or `make review PR=<n>`, then `make merge PR=<n>`). The publisher below runs every job of `scripts/ci/gate_plan.sh` on main (`devkit/bin/check_tree.sh`: the Makefile's `ci-quick`, `ci-db`, `ci-e2e`, `ci-image` and `ci-smoke`, each on its own throwaway Postgres 18 container) before it ships. The browser job runs with the PWA on, as production does; specs sign in through `test/support/e2e-session.ts`. `ci.yml`'s manual jobs (`workflow_dispatch`, its only trigger) call the same make targets.
- **The publisher host publishes** (2026-10-28, one fleet publisher; devkit README "Publish"): homelab's `devkit-publish@closet.timer` runs `make publish` (`devkit/bin/publish.sh`) against a clone kept at `main`. At most once per 3 h window, when main moved, check_tree runs the whole plan on a clean worktree; a red commit files a `main-red` issue and never ships. A green commit that touches no image input (the plan's IMAGE group: `scripts/ci/gate_plan.sh`'s `GATE_IMAGE_EXCLUDE_PATHS`, docs) is recorded as checked, with no push and no tag. Otherwise it builds the newest green `main` (`make ci-image`, native amd64; it refuses any other host), boots it (`make ci-smoke`), pushes `sha-<7>` and points `latest` at the same digest, creates the git tag `ship-<YYYY-MM-DD>-<sha7>` (`devkit/bin/ship_tag.sh`; idempotent, refuses a sha not on `main`) and prunes GHCR to the 10 newest `sha-*` images (`devkit/bin/registry_prune.sh`; never the one `latest` names). Pushing `latest` is the deploy, so the publisher alone moves it, and never backward. Never publish from the Mac (an arm64 image cannot run on the production host); the owner's urgent path on the publisher host is `devkit/bin/publish.sh . --recheck origin/main`, or `--ungated '<reason>'`. Semver releases (`tag-release.yml`, `release/X.Y.Z` branches) and date tags are retired (2026-10-13). Until 2026-10-28 `ci.yml`'s `publish` job did this on Actions. Merging to main is deploying: the homelab autoupdater redeploys within the hour.
- **The image is booted before it is pushed** (#181). The publisher builds it once into the publisher host's Docker (`make ci-image`), runs `scripts/smoke-image.sh` on it against a throwaway Postgres 18 (`make ci-smoke`), then `docker push` sends those exact bytes; a failed smoke test publishes nothing. The script starts it as production does (`node dist/main.js`, NODE_ENV=production, the PWA on, host network) and fails unless `/health/ready` answers 2xx within 60 s with `version` equal to the build's `APP_VERSION` (`BOOT_EXPECT_VERSION`), it runs as uid 1000 with node as PID 1, the boot log says `Applied N Drizzle migration(s)` (so it needs an empty database), `/auth/login` renders in the app shell with `/bundle.css` and `/modules/htmx.min.js` served, and `docker stop` ends it with exit 0 after `SIGTERM: shutting down`. Both directories are Docker volumes owned by uid 1000, as production's chowned mounts; then two more boots prove the Permissions symptoms: a root-owned data volume ends the boot naming the chown, a root-owned models volume leaves `/health/ready` 503 with `storage` down and the chown as its fix. On failure it prints the container's log. A placeholder model file stands in (refused on its checksum, logged as an error), so the boot never downloads 940 MB; the queue waits for a model, as in production when one cannot be had. It adds about a minute to a publish. Run it locally with `make ci-image ci-smoke CI_BUILD_VERSION=<v>`: a throwaway Postgres 18 (`devkit/bin/throwaway_pg.sh`), torn down after.
- **Nightly (`nightly.yml`)**: the page audit (against `docs/perf/baseline.json`) and Lighthouse, and `real cutout model`: the BiRefNet model cached by `actions/cache` under its pinned checksum (fetched or re-verified by the image's own `npm run cutout:fetch-model`), `scripts/smoke-image.sh` with `MODELS_DIR` (the image cuts out one uploaded photo with its own onnxruntime-node and sharp: what a dependency bump or a Dockerfile change breaks and the per-merge smoke test never loads), then `test/integration/cutout-model.spec.ts` with `CUTOUT_MODEL_REQUIRED=1` (a missing model fails it rather than skipping it), and `webkit`: the whole Playwright suite in the `webkit` and `Mobile Safari` projects (#179; the owner's iPhone is WebKit, the main check Chromium only), one job per project with the PWA on, one retry; its `webkit tracking issue` job (the only one with `issues: write`) opens or updates the one issue titled "Nightly WebKit / Mobile Safari run is failing" with the failing specs and the run's link, and closes it on a green run (`scripts/webkit-nightly-issue.sh`; running WebKit locally and what its skips mean: `docs/testing-webkit.md`). About 15 minutes a project, run side by side. Nothing nightly gates a deploy: a red run is a signal to fix the next merge.
