## 2026-10-13 — PR gate moves in-repo via devkit; strict protection off

**Why:** the gate was a closet-only script outside the repo, posting three per-job statuses, updating branches for strict protection and merging on its own. Its scratch databases lived on the shared pgvault-dev. Its path map also sent `test/support/**` to the browser job only, skipping the integration tier that imports it.
**Decision:** devkit's shared skeleton (`make gate PR=<n>`) runs this repo's Makefile `ci-*` targets from `scripts/ci/gate_plan.sh` and posts one `local-gate`. Protection requires `local-gate` + `codex-review` with strict off. The merge queue merges only when the head and `main` it gated are still current, pinned with `--match-head-commit`. That is the guarantee strict gave, without update-branch or carrying `codex-review` over. Tests run on a throwaway Postgres 18 container (`devkit/bin/throwaway_pg.sh`), never pgvault-dev. Fork PRs are refused (public repo; `GATE_ALLOW_FORKS` stays 0).
**Consequence:** a hand merge in the UI can use a `local-gate` from an older `main`; its description names that `main` ("Passed on main abc1234"). Coordinators never enable auto-merge. A check changes in the Makefile, never in the plan or `ci.yml`.
