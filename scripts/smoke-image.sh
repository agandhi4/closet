# Boots a built image as production runs it (`node dist/main.js`, NODE_ENV=production, the PWA on)
# and checks it serves, so a broken Dockerfile or a runtime dependency that no longer loads blocks the
# publish instead of reaching the homelab (#181). The unit and integration tiers never boot main.ts
# or server.ts: this is their test (vitest.config.ts leaves them out of coverage for it).
#
#   ci.yml, publish:     before the image is pushed, with a placeholder model
#   nightly.yml, cutout: with the real BiRefNet model (MODELS_DIR), plus one real cutout
#
# Usage: scripts/smoke-image.sh <image>
# Environment:
#   DATABASE_HOST, DATABASE_PORT (5432), DATABASE_USER, DATABASE_PASS, DATABASE_SCHEMA
#       An empty database: the boot must apply the migrations. The container runs on the host's
#       network, so localhost is the host's (CI's Postgres service, pgvault-dev on linux-box).
#   SMOKE_PORT   where the app listens (3000).
#   MODELS_DIR   a directory holding the verified model (npm run cutout:fetch-model): the app loads it
#                and an uploaded photo must get its cutout. Unset: a placeholder file stands in, which
#                the app refuses on its checksum, so the boot never downloads 940 MB.
#   BOOT_EXPECT_VERSION  the APP_VERSION the image was built with (ci.yml: the 7-char sha; make ci-smoke:
#                CI_BUILD_VERSION): /health/ready's `version` must equal it, so an image that lost the
#                build arg (and reports `dev`) never ships. Same name and rule as devkit's
#                boot_image.sh, which this script does not use (it boots on the host network).
#
# Checks, each fatal: the app runs as uid APP_UID; /health/ready answers 2xx (and names
# BOOT_EXPECT_VERSION when set); the boot log shows the migrations applied; the login page
# renders in the app shell and its stylesheet and htmx are served; devkit's contract probe passes
# (the health contract, request ids, JSON lines, /metrics; below); with MODELS_DIR, a photo uploaded
# over HTTP is cut out by the model in the image's own onnxruntime; `docker stop` (SIGTERM) exits 0.
# Then the non-root image's two failure modes (docs/operations.md#permissions), each its own boot on
# the migrated database: a root-owned data directory ends the boot naming the chown, and a root-owned
# models directory leaves /health/ready 503 with `storage` down and the chown as its fix.
# On failure the container's log is printed.

# Match against a snapshot of the container log, never `docker logs | grep -q`: with pipefail,
