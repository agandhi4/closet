# The area index: the root AGENTS.md is loaded by every session, an area's AGENTS.md only when
# a file in its directory is read (#104), so the root's "### Area index" section is how an agent
# planning work finds an area's doc. Every area doc must be named there in backticks, and every
# `<path>/AGENTS.md` (or CLAUDE.md) the root names anywhere must exist: a stale pointer misleads
# wherever it is (#119). devkit/ is vendored and has its own doc, so it is not an area.
