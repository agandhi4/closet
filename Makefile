# Thin callers: the npm scripts in package.json stay the definitions of each check. These
# targets add only what a clean machine needs around them (a throwaway Postgres, browsers,
# e2e env), so the PR gate (scripts/ci/gate_plan.sh), the publisher host (`make publish`) and
# ci.yml's manual jobs run the same thing.
# Run `make ci-deps` once first; the other ci-* targets assume node_modules.

# Every recipe line runs on .nvmrc's Node, not PATH's (devkit #166): a hand-run target and the
# check_tree read the same toolchain.
