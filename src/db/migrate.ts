 * Brings the database to the schema in drizzle/ at boot, before anything

 * runs (its tree, test/support/legacy-migrations/, is frozen history).
 *
 * - A database built by the legacy MikroORM migrations (it has
 *   `mikro_orm_migrations`, as production does) must have applied the last of
 *   them, LAST_LEGACY_MIGRATION, or the boot is refused. Such a database
 *   already has the baseline's schema, so the baseline (drizzle/0000_*) is
 *   recorded in Drizzle's table exactly as drizzle's migrator would record it,
 *   without running its SQL.
 * - A fresh database runs the baseline like any other migration.
 * - A database whose newest recorded migration this build does not know is
 *   refused before anything is written (SchemaAheadError): an image older
 *   than the database, after a rollback.
 * - Then drizzle's migrate() applies whatever is newer than the last row.
 *
 * Only the server migrates (createApp(), before anything queries). Every
 * step runs on one dedicated connection holding a Postgres advisory lock, so
 * two servers on one database (an overlapping deploy) never migrate at once:
 * the second waits, then finds nothing to do. The CLIs never migrate; they
 * refuse a database that is behind or ahead (requireCurrentSchema).
