 * Washes the listed garments of the owner on `day` (every copy: laundry
 * day) at `at`, its instant on that day or null (instantOnDay, #676); the
 * ids of others and of wishlist items ignored like unknown ones. Returns
 * the garments washed, each with whether its wash moved. Monotone: a wash
 * never moves back, so a queued wash replayed after a later one (#178)
 * changes nothing; washed has no undo. On the same day only a later known
 * instant moves it: a timeless wash never erases a known one (an old
 * client's replay must not uncount the evening's wear), and a known one
 * replaces a timeless one. A later day takes its own instant, null or not.
 * The garment page's Washed, the laundry page's batch, the API, MCP's
 * mark_washed and the seed's Sundays.
 *
 * One statement: the owner lock, the garments named (owned), and the
 * update of only those whose wash moves, so a repeat tap writes no row
 * and sends no revision to the changes feed.
