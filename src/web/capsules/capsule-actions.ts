 * The capsule access path (#188; docs/plans/2026-11-12-json-api.md section
 * 4): every read of one capsule and every change a surface makes to one,
 * each taking the Actor and the address and enforcing access itself, so a
 * page, an MCP tool and the API refuse alike. Capsules are part of the
 * shared wardrobe (owner decision on #8): a view reads them, a MANAGE share
 * (or ownership) changes their membership, and creating, renaming and
 * deleting are the owner's. A capsule outside the wardrobe addressed is a
 * 404 like an unknown id. The queries underneath (queries.ts) trust their
 * `ownerId`: only this path reaches them from a surface.
 *
 * A page that needs the wardrobe before its write (a refused form drawn
 * again) asks its guard first; the writer's own check is then free (one's
 * own wardrobe, or the share the session read ahead), so statement counts
 * hold.
