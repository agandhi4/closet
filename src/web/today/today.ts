/**
 * Today (#15; plan section 9): the household's day for one person, as a
 * row per occasion. The page (routes.tsx), the MCP tool get_today and the
 * push reminders (src/web/push/reminders.ts) all read it here, so the
 * three never disagree about what is planned or suggested.
 *
 * - A row per occasion planned today, holding its entries (occasion order).
 * - While nothing that dresses the day is planned (DAY_OCCASIONS: all day,
 *   work, daytime), an all-day row of suggestions first: a page of
 *   TODAY_IDEAS from ideasFor for today's forecast, the day's seed
 *   (dailySeed, as the gallery opens with), so a reload shows the same
 *   three and Refresh walks the pages.
 * - The person's weather (settings and forecast), read once beside the
 *   entries: the page's line and the ideas' matching share it.
 *
 * Whether anything was worn today is read only when asked (`worn`, in the
 * same statement): the page never shows it (#158); get_today asks, and the
 * evening reminder reads it for every evening person at once (eveningDays).
 * So are Muse's needs waiting on the owner's choice (`needs`, #333) and
 * its latest round while any of it waits (#337), which only the page
 * shows, as one card: the round's while it waits, else the needs'. So is
 * the first-run gate (`firstRun`, #666): until the closet can be dressed
 * as an outfit the page leads with adding garments and offers no plan,
 * and no ideas are drawn (none could be).
