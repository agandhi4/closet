 * A checklist's post: the capsule picker, the garment page's capsule

 * Shown and unchecked is what leaves (`unchecked`); an id the list never
 * showed (a page not scrolled to, a row added meanwhile elsewhere) is left
 * alone. Nothing checked posts no field at all, so the body may be empty.
 * Each listed row carries `ShownId` beside its checkbox; guards.conf
 * `@checklist-shown` keeps `name="shown"` in this module.
 *
 * The checked field keeps each list's own name (`ids`, `capsuleIds`,
 * `packed`): cached pages post it.
