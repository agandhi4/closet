 * restore (`maintenance:after-restore`'s epoch bump: `sep`, #908), the
 * account deleted elsewhere (no row), a rotated ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET or a garbled
 * token (the signature), and expiry. This is the one place such a device is
 * noticed, so it is where it drops the account's HTTP cache (selfies,
 * pages); the session gate's redirect or 401 then carries both headers (and
 * the relay's marker, so the page it lands on repeats the clear: #244), and
 * the login page it lands on drops the browser's push subscription
 * (PushSignedOut, src/web/push/settings.tsx). A request without the cookie
 * gets neither header: nothing was signed in there.
