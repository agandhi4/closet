 * per window instead of one per call (#940; the NAS log freeze was #632).
 * Each answer is unchanged; only the line is deferred and counted.
 *
 * No timers: a summary is written when its window has ended, found by the
 * next refusal of any address (`flushEnded`), or when `CAPACITY` addresses
 * are held and the oldest makes room. Memory is `CAPACITY` small entries. An
 * address that stops while nobody else is refused leaves its summary
 * unwritten until the next refusal or the process ends: the cost of no timer.
