 * page navigation without a session is a 302 to the login page, an htmx
 * fragment or fetch a bodiless 401 with `HX-Redirect`. Both are routine, so
 * they log at debug. Both send the login page the page to come back to
 * (bounceReturnTo, return-to.ts), so a session that ended mid-task returns
 * there after sign-in; the log line names the request through loggableUrl,
 * never the Location, whose returnTo may carry an invite token. When the request's cookie was rejected, the resolver
 * has already set the cleared cookie and Clear-Site-Data on this reply
 * (endSession, session.ts), and both answers keep them: never reset the
 * reply's headers here.
