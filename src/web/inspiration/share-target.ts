 * share's POST navigation itself (receiveShare, from views/assets/src-sw.ts)
 * and **never sends it to the server**: the worker cannot tell Android's
 * share from a cross-site page auto-submitting the same form (neither has
 * a client id or an Origin it can read), and relaying either would post
 * with our Origin and the session's cookie, a CSRF bypass (docs/decisions.md
 * 2026-11-13). A shared photo is kept on the device and saved only by the
 * confirmation page's own native post to POST /inspiration; a share
 * without one goes on to the link page's GET, which saves nothing. Only
 * when no worker controls the page (storage cleared, not yet installed)
 * does the share reach the server's POST /inspiration/share, which writes
 * nothing either (routes.tsx, shareFallback).
 *
 * This module imports only modules that import nothing: the worker's
 * bundle imports it, and the server (the manifest, the confirmation page).
