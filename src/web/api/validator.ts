/**
 * The /api/v1 scope's validator compiler (apiPlugin): a JSON body is
 * validated as sent, never coerced. Fastify's ajv coerces types by default
 * (`coerceTypes: 'array'`), which the pages need (a form posts strings, a
 * single row as scalars) but which corrupts JSON: a `0`, `""` or `false`
 * meets `{ type: 'null' }` as null and `"3"` passes as 3. Querystring and
 * params arrive as strings, so they keep the coercing compiler (`?limit=20`).
 *
 * A querystring is also closed: a parameter the route does not declare is a
 * 400 naming it (#577), never silently ignored (a client's misspelled
 * `?categroy=` would answer the unfiltered list). The one place, so a route
 * added later is strict without work; a parameter a route accepts must be
 * declared. `removeAdditional` is off for it: with `additionalProperties:
 * false`, ajv's default would strip the key instead of failing.
 *
 * Both are @fastify/ajv-compiler, the factory Fastify itself builds its
 * compiler with, with the root's options (app.ts sets none), so formats,
 * `useDefaults` and `removeAdditional` stay as on every other route. Built
 * on the first route compiled, when the scope's shared schemas (Problem)
 * are all added; a request schema referring to one a child scope adds
 * would fail the boot as an unresolved $ref, never pass unchecked.
