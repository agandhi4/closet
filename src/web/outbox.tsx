/**
 * The markup of the writes the installed app queues offline (#178, plan
 * section 5; the kinds in src/offline-writes.ts). The page's outbox
 * (views/assets/outbox.ts) only reads it: which state to show is drawn here,
 * never by script.
 *
 * - A queueable form carries `data-offline-queue="<kind>"` instead of
 *   `data-needs-network` (`queueForm`), so connectivity.js leaves it enabled
 *   offline and the outbox takes its submit.
 * - A region (`outboxRegion`) is one record: its key, the path it replays
 *   to and the name the notices give it. Around a form it is that form's
 *   write; inside a form (the laundry's rows, the packing lists' rows) each
 *   row is one, posted by itself.
 * - `OutboxAlternate` holds the control's other state (Wore today ↔ Undo,
 *   Wore it ↔ ✓ Worn), which the outbox swaps in when it queues the tap and
 *   again when a cached page reopens with the record waiting; a checkbox is
 *   its own other state.
 * - `OutboxPending` is the region's "Waiting to sync", shown by main.css
 *   while the outbox marks the region `data-outbox="pending"`.
