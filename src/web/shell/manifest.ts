 * src/web/inspiration/share-target.ts): a photo waits for the confirmation
 * page's Save, a link opens the link import, fetching nothing until Fetch.
 * When no worker controls the page, the server's route answers it, writing
 * nothing (share-fallback.ts). Without the worker at all (PWA_ENABLED off)
 * the target stays the link import's GET, links only.
