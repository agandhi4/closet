 * The one way the outbound fetcher (outbound-fetch.ts) opens a connection,

 * checked, an IP literal, so nothing between the check and the connect
 * resolves a name (DNS rebinding). Over TLS the certificate is verified
 * against the URL's name, which is also the SNI; a URL naming an IP literal
 * is verified against that IP and sends no SNI (Node refuses an IP as
 * servername). When ALPN picks h2, the HTTP/2 session is built here, on that
 * socket and no other (#496b): no session can reach an address `pin()` did
 * not check, and none is ever reused for another hop.
