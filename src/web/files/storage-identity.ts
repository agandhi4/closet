 * storage whose every photo is gone, and reconciliation would act on it
 * while uploads landed where the remount hides them. So the directory
 * carries a marker (STORAGE_MARKER), written only when this process can
 * prove the directory is the right one:
 *   - the `file` table is empty: a first boot, nothing to lose;
 *   - the directory holds the sets of at least ADOPT_MIN_COVERAGE of the
 *     rows: an existing share from before the marker, adopted.
 * Anything else unmarked is the unmounted share or the wrong directory, and
 * so is a marker that cannot be read: refused, nothing written there.
 *
 * And the marker must be this database's (#833): the `install` row records
 * its install id, written by the claim that writes or adopts the marker
 * (or, at the first claim after that table shipped, from the marker already
 * there), so a marked share from another install, or a database restored
 * from another install's dump, is refused. A marker this claim writes
 * carries the paired id, so re-adopting a restored, unmarked share pairs.
 * Only `enforced` pairing (APP_ENV production) refuses a mismatch: in dev
 * and gate, worktrees each with their own DATA_PATH share one database, so
 * it is one warn line and the claim goes on (#650's rules apply in all).
 *
 * Called by createPhotos, so the server's boot and every CLI that writes
 * photos (reconcile, retrim, seed) refuse the same directory.
