 * Removing a calendar entry is reversible (#686) when putting it back

 * wears and selfie, a one-off outfit (the planner's, an idea's: the row
 * shows its collage, not a name) is pruned with it (#748), and an agent's
 * choice carries a token the restore does not rewrite. Those are asked
 * first, by the confirm sheet; the rest act at once and the toast offers
 * Undo.
 *
 * The rule is `removalAsksFirst` (removal.ts), which the row's hint and the
 * server's decision (deleteEntry's `asksFirst`, from the current row) both
 * call, so a page gone stale never deletes irreversibly unasked.
