/**
 * Who owns a calendar entry's choice, as SQL: the one place the writers of
 * `outfit_calendar.planned_by` and `planned_by_token_id` get their values
 * (#16, #682; the ranks are src/wardrobe/week.ts's PLANNED_BY, with
 * `replannable`).
 *
 * - The planner writes `auto` (pickIdea's `chooser: 'planner'`); only those
 *   entries are ever re-planned or undone (the week plan's `= 'auto'`
 *   filters), so an agent's entry is as safe from it as a person's.
 * - The agent over MCP writes `agent` with its token; the person `user`
 *   with none (`chooserOf`).
 * - A write choosing the outfit already on the day takes the entry over
 *   only from a lower rank (`takeOverSql`): the person from the agent or the
 *   planner, the agent from the planner, never back.
 * - Changing an entry's outfit (replaceEntryOutfit) makes it the chooser's,
 *   whoever had it; marking it worn, editing its outfit and "Wearing this"
 *   make it the person's (`PERSONS_CHOICE`): the wear is their record.
