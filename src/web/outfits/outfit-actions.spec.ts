 * records this slice moved: outfits are private, so a share never widens
 * what an actor reaches. Every query answers for `actor.userId` alone, so
 * a VIEW or MANAGE grantee of the owner's wardrobe asks for their own
 * outfit `OUTFIT`, finds none (as the owner-scoped SQL would), and is the
 * 404 of an unknown id, never a 403 that would say the outfit exists
 * (test/integration/authorization-outfits.routes.ts proves the routes).
