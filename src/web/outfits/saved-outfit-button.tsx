 * would change nothing (`note`: already on the day, already on the trip) or
 * be refused: an incomplete outfit (#335) is neither planned nor packed
 * until its pieces are bought. Disabled reads through the card (flat, on
 * the plinth colour) and its dimmed picture; the name and the reason stay
 * at full strength (text is never dimmed: Conventions). The picture is
 * hidden from assistive tech, as the old thumbs' empty alts were: the
 * button's name is the outfit's, and the note says what is to buy.
