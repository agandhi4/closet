/**
 * One poll of the order mail account (#25; plan
 * docs/plans/2026-09-28-order-email-import.md): the inbox's new emails,
 * each judged by its sender (trust.ts), its links judged before any fetch
 * (links.ts: product paths and known trackers only, #698) and each one's
 * page through the link import's reader (readProductPage: the user URL
 * fetcher, SSRF-safe, bounded, every redirect a product link), and the
 * products it names listed for
 * ORDER_MAIL_OWNER's account to review. Run by server.ts's timer through
 * pollOrderMailWhole inside metrics.timeJob('order_mail'), so a failure
 * (JMAP unreachable or refusing, an unknown owner, a failing email) counts
 * as the job's.
 *
 * Each email gets its own outcome (#693). A decided one is recorded once
 * its links were read, in one transaction with its items
 * (recordOrderEmail). One whose read fails is a `failed` row, read again
 * by the next poll (the watermark starts at it) and parked after
 * ORDER_MAIL_ATTEMPTS; the poll goes on to the next email. A failure
 * that is not the email's (JMAP unreachable, the database out of reach:
 * failureScope's `outage`) fails the run and touches no row; its own
 * message's fetch answering a 5xx or a wrong shape is a strike on its row,
 * and ORDER_MAIL_MAILBOX_STRIKES in a row spend one attempt. A link that fails to fetch is skipped (the fetcher logs
 * its host and reason).
