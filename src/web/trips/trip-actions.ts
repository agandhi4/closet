 * alike. Trips are private (AGENTS.md): only the actor's own are reached,
 * whatever wardrobe shares they hold, so another's trip, trip outfit or
 * extra is the 404 of an unknown id, never a 403. The owner-scoped queries
 * underneath (queries.ts, packed.ts, model.ts) trust their `ownerId`: only
 * this path reaches them from a surface (the trips list and create aside,
 * which refuse nothing). Refusals carry a `logDetail` where the message
