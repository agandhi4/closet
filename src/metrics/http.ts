 * device beacon may name only those), each request answers with its
 * RequestTiming (created by src/request-context.ts) as `Server-Timing` (db,
 * render, the route template; not once a secret was checked,
 * markSecretChecked) and lands in
 * http_request_duration_seconds under its route template, never its URL, so
 * ids never become series. A request the service worker made to warm the
 * offline caches (#286: hundreds of renders a day per device, no one
 * waiting) is left out, so the latencies stay a person's.
 *
 * Hooks, not a plugin: added to the root, they apply to every route
 * registered after them (AGENTS.md Gotchas, plugin inheritance).
