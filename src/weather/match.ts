/**
 * Weather matching (#14; plan section 7): what a day's weather asks of an
 * outfit worn for an occasion, and how well an outfit answers it. Pure and
 * the one place the rules live: the outfit generator (#9) ranks and filters
 * with it, Today (#15) explains its picks with it, the MCP tools report it,
 * and the seed's simulated weather is checked against it
 * (src/seed/weather.spec.ts). Availability (isAvailable,
 * src/wardrobe/availability.ts) is a separate question: filter first, then
 * match.
 *
 * The steps:
 * 1. The occasion's window (OCCASION_HINTS: work 8 to 18, evening 18 to
 *    23, ...) picks the day's hours that matter.
 * 2. Their feels-like range, with the user's personal offset added
 *    (src/weather/temperature.ts), is what to dress for.
 * 3. That sets a target warmth: for the torso, the warmths of the top (or
 *    one-piece) and the layer combined (1 a tank ... 9 a sweater under a
 *    parka); for legs and feet, one garment's warmth (1-4).
 * 4. A large swing across the window (its coolest and warmest hours
 *    LAYER_STEPS or more torso steps apart, about 8 °C) asks for a layer that
 *    comes off: the outfit with it is judged by the coolest hours, without it
 *    by the warmest. A swing inside the heat (25 to 33 °C) asks for nothing:
 *    both ends want a tee.
 * 5. Rain in the window (any hour at RAIN_CHANCE or more) asks for a
 *    water-resistant layer, footwear or accessory, unless the umbrella
 *    answers it (WeatherNeeds.umbrella: warm rain hours, or the owner's
 *    water-resistant accessory, withRainGear): then it is advice for the
 *    day, "Take the umbrella", and no outfit is judged on it (#648).
