 *
 * 1. bumpSyncEpoch: every device's cursor answered before is a 410, so each
 *    re-syncs in full (the dump's revisions and ids would be read as the
 *    history it already has), and every session cookie issued before it no
 *    longer opens a session (its `sep`, #908): the household signs in again.
 * 2. Every personal access token, agent and device, revoked through the
 *    statement a new password uses (revokeAllTokensStatement), and every
 *    push subscription (#908): a restore brings back what was revoked after
 *    the dump (a lost phone's token), and nothing outside the database
 *    remembers it. Owners re-issue their tokens; each device turns
 *    notifications on again.
 * 3. Cutout leases older than DEAD_LEASE_MS released, each through the state
 *    machine (`release` naming the row's own worker, under the owner and
 *    row locks), so their photos run again at once.
 * 4. Reconciliation as a dry run: nothing deleted, quarantined, purged or
 *    marked (the next real run does that), and the garments whose original
 *    it did not find listed for the operator.
 *
 * Every step is safe to repeat: a second run bumps the epoch again (one
 * more full re-sync, everyone signed out again) and finds nothing to revoke
 * or release. The epoch and the revocations run even when reconciliation
 * refuses: the database was restored either way. Never migrates (runCli's schema check).
