                       properties each role has (propertyApplies), the types per category with their

## Gotchas

- **The generator's output is pinned** (`generator-output.spec.ts`, #168): exact ideas, order, scores and `more` for seeded closets. A change for speed must pass it unchanged; one that changes it on purpose bumps `GENERATOR_VERSION` and re-pins. Its early stops (`generator-draws.spec.ts`) are sound only because the colour, pattern and clash rules never pass once they fail (adding a garment cannot mend them), the formality score is a sum over garments and the weather's is never negative (`scoreFloor`), and every base has a draw weight above 0. A rule that adding a garment could mend goes in `passes`, not `compatible` (the saved-outfit rule: a layer changes the combination); a score part that could go negative or stop adding up breaks the floor.

- **Outfit rules (#21) split by whether a garment mends them.** A never-rule only worsens as garments are added, so it lives in `compatible` (and prunes: a pool garment that breaks one with a lock is never counted among the bases, offered as a layer or used as a mend, so a role it empties ends the request with no draw); an always-rule is mended by adding a B, so it lives in `passes` with the drawer's one repair step (`repairer`: a base with an A and no B gets a B in that role's slot, chosen by a sequence keyed on the seed and the base). An always-rule is moot when no drawable B could take an open slot and still pass `compatible` with the rest of the outfit (`alwaysCheck`: a drawn unlocked garment of B's role to swap, or a layer while layers are offered; the repair picks from the same swaps), so it never empties the ideas: a B that clashes with the outfit's other garments leaves it standing. A never-rule two locked garments break flags every idea (`'breaks-rule'`, `Idea.brokenRules`) instead of emptying them; a caller probing a pair by locking it (Goes-with's `layerChecks`) must read the flag. The pruning never changes the draws: non-viable bases are still drawn (the sequence picks by position in the whole role) and skipped, so a request without rules gives the pinned output.

- **Adding an occasion is a migration.** `outfit_calendar_occasion_check`, `week_template_occasion_check` and `trip_outfit_occasion_check` list `src/wardrobe/occasions.ts`'s `OCCASIONS`, so a new one fails every insert until `npx drizzle-kit generate` recreates the constraint; add its `occasion.<value>` string (a missing one is a type error). The display order is the array's order: reordering it is code only.
- **Some types are never drawn, and `other` means none applies** (#685): a type with `drawn: false` (socks, underwear, swimwear, sleepwear) is left out of the generator's pool (`isDrawnType` in `drawableByRole`), which every idea, plan and Shuffle reads. `OTHER_TYPE` ends the lists that cannot be complete (not tops or bottoms), so tagging can be answered honestly; it has no presets, no art shape and is no look piece's type.
- **A workout is dressed in activewear by type** (#647): `GarmentType.purpose: 'active'` (running shoes, running shorts, leggings, joggers, sports tops; not sweatpants, lounge wear) is code only, no column. `OCCASION_HINTS.workout.active` keeps its bottoms and footwear for active types (the generator's pool and templates: no idea, so an empty planner slot, rather than a near miss), spares legs and feet the cold floor (`assessOutfit`) and its layer the formality range. Every caller drawing for an occasion spreads `occasionDemands(occasion)` into its request, never `formality` alone.
- **Adding a property value, a garment type, a colour or a style is a migration.** The check constraints (`garment`'s and `style_profile`'s, #34) list `src/wardrobe/properties.ts`'s, `care.ts`' and `style.ts`'s sets, so a new value there fails every insert until `npx drizzle-kit generate` recreates the constraint; add its `property.<name>.<value>` string too (`labels.spec.ts` fails without it). Removing a value needs a data step for rows that hold it.
