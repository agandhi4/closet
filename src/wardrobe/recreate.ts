/**
 * "Recreate this look" (#22; docs/plans/2026-11-13-inspiration-library.md,
 * section 4): the owner's closet garments closest to each piece they tagged
 * in a saved look, chosen so the chosen set goes together. Pure and
 * deterministic (no seed: every tie has an order), so the look's match
 * view (src/web/inspiration) and, later, MCP's get_inspiration answer the
 * same for the same closet.
 *
 * - **Candidates** for a piece are the closet's garments of its role
 *   (the caller passes inCloset garments: dirty and away ones too, a look
 *   is recreated from what the owner has, not from what is clean today).
 * - **Ranking**, in this order: the type equal; the colours (the piece's
 *   main colour, then its accent; equal before a close shade, CLOSE_COLORS);
 *   the pattern equal; then available before not, the most rested
 *   (rotationWeight), the oldest id.
 * - **The floor**: a garment is a match only when it shares the piece's
 *   type or one of its colours (a close shade counts). A piece naming
 *   neither takes any garment of its role. A piece with no match is missing.
 * - **Saved choices** are pinned: a garment saved for a piece that still
 *   matches it (it is in the closet and clears the floor) is that piece's
 *   garment before anything is ranked or matched, always among its matches
 *   however far down its ranking, and no other piece is offered or given
 *   it (the first piece to name one keeps it). The rest are matched around
 *   them, so the chosen garments are unique by construction.
 * - **Going together**: the chosen set must pass the generator's colour and
 *   pattern rule (colorsGoTogether) and break none of the owner's
 *   never-rules (avoided pairs included), and no garment fills two pieces:
 *   when pieces outnumber their garments, the most pieces are filled (a
 *   flexible piece yields another's only garment), each in look order
 *   keeping the closest that costs no later piece its garment.
 *   What the look itself breaks is excused (the owner saved it: the pieces
 *   judged as garments), as the generator excuses a rule two locked
 *   garments break. When the closest set clashes, the sets that stray
 *   least from it are tried (fewest steps down the pieces' rankings, the
 *   loudest piece moved first); when none within the search goes, the
 *   closest are kept and the clashing pieces named (`unfixed`).
