 * behind "Worn and planned". `outfit.origin`, written by createOutfit and
 * raised (never lowered) by a later save of the same garments
 * (adoptOutfit, src/web/week-plan/adopt.ts) and made `person` by any edit.
 *
 * - `person`: saved on purpose (the outfit form, Styling, a pick with no
 *   destination, a recreated look, the API); every outfit before #659
 *   that the migration could not prove otherwise.
 * - `agent`: the owner's agent saved it (create_outfit, a proposal, a
 *   pick_outfit with no date).
 * - `idea`: an idea picked for a day, a trip or a replace ("Wear this").
 * - `planner`: "Plan my week" made it.
