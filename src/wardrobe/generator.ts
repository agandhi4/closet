/**
 * The outfit generator (#9; docs/plans/2026-09-26-wardrobe-features.md,
 * section 3; the redesign's "Suggest", docs/plans/2026-09-26-redesign.md
 * section 1): whole outfits from a pool of garments, seeded and paged. Pure
 * and the one place suggestion rules live. Its callers:
 * - the Outfits page's Ideas (src/web/gallery), through ideasFor, which
 *   reads the pool, the weather and the owner's rows;
 * - the MCP tool suggest_outfits (src/web/mcp/tools/gallery.ts);
 * - "Goes with my closet" (#18b, src/wardrobe/goes-with.ts): the whole
 *   closet as the pool and one wishlist item `locked`;
 * - Styling's Shuffle (#42, src/web/styling): its locked rows are
 *   `locked`, the unlocked rows take the first idea; Today's suggestions
 *   (#15: a day's occasion, a page of 3).
 *
 * The caller decides the pool: garments in the closet and available
 * (isAvailable / availableGarment, src/wardrobe/availability.ts: not
 * dirty, not away), within a capsule when one is chosen. The generator
 * never widens it. What it decides:
 * - Templates: top + bottom + footwear, or one-piece + footwear; footwear
 *   only when the closet has some (a first-week wardrobe of tees and jeans
 *   still gets ideas). A layer only when the weather asks for one (or it is
 *   locked). Accessories, bags and uncategorised garments are never drawn;
 *   locked, they ride along.
 * - Rotation: each role is drawn weighted toward the garment worn least
 *   recently (days since its last wear day; never worn weighs most), so the
 *   gallery rotates the wardrobe instead of showing the favourites.
 * - Hard rules, never relaxed: at most MAX_ACCENT_COLORS non-neutral
 *   colours and MAX_LOUD_PATTERNS patterned garment; the owner's outfit
 *   rules (outfit-rules.ts: never A with B, always B with A, the avoided
 *   pairs of generator_avoid among the never-rules); no combination equal
 *   to a saved outfit (compared on the drawn roles, so a saved outfit with
 *   a belt still counts); every locked garment in every idea. A never-rule
 *   the locked garments break among themselves does not empty the ideas:
 *   each is flagged 'breaks-rule', naming it (brokenRules).
 * - Soft rules, a score: the weather (assessOutfit, src/weather/match.ts)
 *   and the occasion's formality (OCCASION_HINTS, one step per garment
 *   outside the range). Ideas that fit (score 0) come first in draw order;
 *   once the draws run out, the near misses follow, best first, each with
 *   its problems named.
 *
 * Paging is stable: the draws are a sequence keyed by the seed, so page n
 * is the same every time it is asked for (for the same pool), and page 1
 * never changes when page 3 is read. Nothing is materialized: a closet of
 * 40 tops, 20 bottoms and 10 shoes is sampled, at most MAX_DRAWS draws a
 * page.
