/**
 * Caching model (public/js/pwa.js and public/js/freshness.js are the page
 * side):
 *  - App shell files under public/ are precached by content hash
 *    (scripts/generate-sw.ts), one precache per static build, so a repeat
 *    visit paints from cache.
 *  - The tab roots (/wardrobe, /outfits, /calendar) opened as a document are
 *    stale-while-revalidate: the cached copy at once, kept only until the
 *    page (freshness.js) reads it was cached through Navigation Timing and
 *    asks for the server's behind it (REVALIDATE_PAGE), which swaps it in
 *    or offers it when it differs.
 *  - Every other page and every htmx request is NetworkFirst with a short
 *    timeout: fresh when the server is quick, the last copy (stamped, so the
 *    page can say how old it is) when it is not, /offline.html when there is
 *    none. Fragments are keyed apart from pages. Navigations use the
 *    navigation preload response, so the request is already on the wire
 *    while a cold worker boots.
 *  - The page cache holds one account's pages (src/web/page-cache.ts). It
 *    and the image cache are the session's caches (SESSION_CACHES), dropped
 *    together when a session starts or ends here, and when a page rendered
 *    for another account arrives. Every drop starts a new generation, and an
 *    answer to a request started in an older one is never stored.
 *  - A `?v=` script or style is answered from the precache of the build it
 *    names (PRECACHE), so a page an older build stored meets its own
 *    build's; garment images
 *    are CacheFirst so recently viewed items render offline. Outfit selfies
 *    are never the worker's to cache (the browser's HTTP cache holds them).
 *  - WARM_PAGES (from pwa.js on every signed-in load): first the pages an
 *    older build stored are fetched again (the activation refresh), then, at
 *    most once a day, the account's whole wardrobe, its pages and thumbs,
 *    into the session caches through the same plugins, so it reads offline
 *    (src/web/shell/offline-warm.md).
 *  - The page's outbox (outbox.ts) queues writes; the worker sends none. It
 *    deletes other accounts' records when a page for a new account arrives,
 *    and refetches the cached pages a sync changed (OUTBOX_SYNCED;
 *    src/web/shell/outbox.md).
 *  - A navigation that is not a GET (a form post: signing in or out) is
 *    never sent on by the worker (navigationPostAnswer, below; it answers
 *    only the share target, on the device); our own pages announce a
 *    sign-in or sign-out first (SESSION_ENDING), which drops the session
 *    caches.
 *  - Anything unmatched (other POSTs, /health/live) goes straight to the network.
 *
 * Built by `npm run generate:sw` with NODE_ENV=production, which strips
 * Workbox's development logging and assertions; the console.* calls here are
 * the worker's only logs.

 * The activation refresh (#656, src/web/shell/AGENTS.md, Updates): every

 * (an older build rendered it) is fetched again, one at a time in the
 * cache's own order, through refetchCachedPage and refetchInTurn. The cache
 * is the to-do list: a key is due while its copy is stamped before
 * ACTIVATED_AT_KEY, so a run cut short (offline, the server unavailable or
 * throttling) resumes at the next WARM_PAGES with what is left, and a second
 * deploy makes this build's copies due again. One page failing (a 500) is
 * passed over and stays due, but backs off (#782, RefreshBackoff in
 * page-cache.ts): a record beside it says when it is asked again, 5 min
 * doubling to a day, and runs before then pass it over unasked. Until a key
 * is replaced, its older copy is NetworkFirst's offline answer. Its own
 * generation, like any run: a drop stops it, and whatever it had in flight
 * is refused (runOf). True when the walk asked every key not backing off,
 * failed ones included, so the daily warm is never held back by one bad
 * page; then REFRESHED_AT_KEY (with the earliest backoff's end) spares every
 * WARM_PAGES before that end the scan.
